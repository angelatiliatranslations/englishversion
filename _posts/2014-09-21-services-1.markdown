A translation takes your words on a journey to an incredible destination. If you’re looking for a professional to translate your text from English to Italian or from Polish to Italian, I can help make the journey more comfortable. I specialise in art, craft production, sustainability, fashion, marketing and advertising, but I’m also very happy to work on texts that don’t fall under any of these categories. If you’re unsure, simply send me an email explaining your project and I’ll get back to you with more details, obligation free. The cost of a translation is always calculated based on the number of words in your file, and includes an analysis of the text, terminology research, the translation itself and a final proofread.
